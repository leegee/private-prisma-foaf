# Testing Prisma

## Synopsis

    npm run db:start       # Start pg in a Docker container
    npm run db:stop

    npm run anew           # Build scheme, populate db, create ERD, test
    npm test               # Run all tests
    npm run test:unit      # Run unit tests without the database
    npm run test:int       # Run integration tests upon the db and Prisma

## Scheme

A simplistic star scheme that centers on actions, used to describe who did what to whom, when it happened, with citations,
where the 'who' is an `Entity` (either a person or organisation).

## About the environment

Tests need to look after the environment, to leave things as they were found. Whilst this is always a good habit to maintain,
it can ben an effort that quickly becomes a chore, and so frequently gets discarded, leading to a build up of unused cruft
in the database that is never in a known state, leading to false positive test failures, leading to time spent debugging
tests rather than writing logic.

Thus the test suite aims to make keeping the environment clean as easy as possible, by mocking where possible and practicle,
and using known-state environment fixetures.

## Writiing integration tests

Tests which touch any real system, other than the unit under test, are considered integration tests, and
are be suffixed `.int.spec.ts`.

    /**
    * @jest-environment ./test/lib/prisma-test-env.ts
    */

Don't bother with the above "Jest custom environment" docblock, it is both non-blocking and slow, so fails to
complete execution before it can configure the connection string used in the tests.

Instead, call the custom environment manually, so it can set beforeEach and afterEach hooks to clean the environment.

    import PrismaTestEnvironment from "testlib/prisma-test-env";

    PrismaTestEnvironment.init();

## Writing Unit Tests

See examples.

## TODO

- Real graphviz
- Deeper mock RVs
- Playwrite
- Percy

## NOTES

Use of a long-running global transaction apparently not supported

# Proposed Ingestion Format

Should be easy for non-techies to edit by hand.

## Entity (DoB-DoD)

### `perlre` definition:

    /^ \w* ([^\(]+) \w+ \( (\d{4}–\d{2}–\d{2]) \w*-\w* (\d{4}–\d{2}–\d{2]) \w* ) $/

### Examples:

    Andre Puharich (1918-02-19 – 1995-01-03)
    heosophical Society
    Anthroposophical Society

## Entity-Verb-Entity

### `perlre` definition:

    /^ \w*
      \[                    # Surrounded by square brackets,
        ([^\]]+)            # $1 Subject
      \]                    # End square bracket surrounding subject
       \w* --\> \w*         # --> arrow, maybe surrounded by whitespace
      \|                    # Surrounded by bars
         ( [^\|]+ )         # $2 Verb
      \|                    # nd bars surrounding verb
      \w*                   # May be whitespace
      \[                    # Surrounded by square brackets
        ( [^\]]+ )          # $3 Object
      \]                    # End square brackets surrounding object
      \w*                   # May be whitespace
      # (.+)?               # $4 Comment
      \w*                   # May be whitespace at the end of the line
    $/x
