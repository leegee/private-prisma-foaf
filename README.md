# Testing Prisma

## Synopsis

    npm run db:start       # Start pg in a Docker container
    npm run db:stop

    npm run anew           # Build scheme, populate db, create ERD, test
    npm test               # Run all tests
    npm run test:unit      # Run unit tests without the database
    npm run test:int       # Run integration tests upon the db and Prisma

## Scheme

A simplistic star scheme that centers on actions, used to describe who did what to whom, when it happened, with citations,
where the 'who' is an `Entity` (either a person or organisation).

## Writiing integration tests

Since the tests are `.spec.ts`, and `.int` must be added to the filename to signify an integration test,
so the default environment is `node`.

Use the "Jest custom environment" by adding the following docblock, to produce a schema per test file:

    /**
    * @jest-environment ./test/lib/prisma-test-env.ts
    */

## TODO

- Deeper mock RVs
- Playwrite
- Percy

## NOTES

Use of a long-running global transaction apparently not supported

# Proposed Ingestion Format

Should be easy for non-techies to edit by hand.

## Entity (DoB-DoD)

### `perlre` definition:

    /^ \w* ([^\(]+) \w+ \( (\d{4}–\d{2}–\d{2]) \w*-\w* (\d{4}–\d{2}–\d{2]) \w* ) $/

### Examples:

    Andre Puharich (1918-02-19 – 1995-01-03)
    heosophical Society
    Anthroposophical Society

## Entity-Verb-Entity

### `perlre` definition:

    /^ \w*
      \[                    # Surrounded by square brackets,
        ([^\]]+)            # $1 Subject
      \]                    # End square bracket surrounding subject
       \w* --\> \w*         # --> arrow, maybe surrounded by whitespace
      \|                    # Surrounded by bars
         ( [^\|]+ )         # $2 Verb
      \|                    # nd bars surrounding verb
      \w*                   # May be whitespace
      \[                    # Surrounded by square brackets
        ( [^\]]+ )          # $3 Object
      \]                    # End square brackets surrounding object
      \w*                   # May be whitespace
      # (.+)?               # $4 Comment
      \w*                   # May be whitespace at the end of the line
    $/x
